## Why?

I wanted a dev landing page to showcase everything I do online and I wanted it to be minimal and right to the point rather beautiful and hefty. And I think most of the devs out there would want the same.

So I sat down one morning and created this **Dev Landing Page** which is a copy of Dinesh Pandiyan's work.

Here's my **Dev Landing Page** - [Dogukan Ermis - portfolio v1](https://d-ermis.github.io/)
